## Installing CocoaPods

The app currently uses CocoaPods to manage critical dependencies. You can install CocoaPods on your local machine via the following command:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After that, just navigate to the folder into which you cloned this repository, and run:

```
pod install
```

And now you should be good to go! An updated .xcworkspace file should have been created in the folder. Be sure to open that file whenever you edit the code. DO NOT OPEN THE .xcodeproj FOLDER - IT WILL NOT WORK.
